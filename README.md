# Iscas2026

Implementations extending the [project presented at iscas 2025](https://github.com/leonardoLavagna/Iscas2025) for [Iscas 2026](https://2026.ieee-iscas.org/).

## What's in here?
Here you can find the code we used in the project.
* `utilities` contains functions to carry out random walks, Grover searches and frequency attacks on the Caesar's cipher and the AES cipher in a unified (NISQ) framework.
* `notebooks` contains the script we used to get the main results in the project. There are 4 notebooks: the first two are about the unification of (NISQ) cryptographic attacks under the Grover search and quantum walk models, the last two are about time-space tradeoffs in symmetric (NISQ) protocols with the presence of quantum channels.
* `config.py` is a configuration file used to specify some settings (e.g. the noise model).
* `requirements.txt` contains the requirements (install the file before using the code in this repository).
* `LICENSE.txt`: MIT License.
